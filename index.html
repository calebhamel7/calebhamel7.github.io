          <h2>Kate's Lion Pride Run</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My eleventh grade english teacher, Kate Fletcher, has been putting on an amazing event since 2016 called the <a href= 'https://www.gofundme.com/f/kate039s-lion-pride-run' target= '_blank'>Lion Pride Run</a>. Kate was inspired to start running by her students to show them that any goal is possible with dedication and hard work. Every year Kate runs mind blowing distances and to fund a scholarship program for her students. This year she ran from Louisa County High School to Washington D.C. (105 Miles!). Please check out her cause and consider donating!
